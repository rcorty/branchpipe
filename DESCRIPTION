Description: This is an experimental R package that attempts to apply some 
    concepts from git into magrittr/dplyr pipes. The first goal will be to 
    figure out whether a branch and merge function could serve to facilitate the
    common sequence of modifying, summarising, then joining back to the modified
    data.  An example is provided in branchpipe.R and documentation file branch.Rd.
